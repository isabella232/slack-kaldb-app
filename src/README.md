# KalDb Grafana App

This project extends functionality provided by Grafana to support integration with the
[KalDb](https://github.com/slackhq/kaldb) datastore. The app includes a datasource and an improved explore
interface to support features such as full-range histograms.

Once installed a new datasource type will be available, and the KalDb explore icon will appear on the left side of the 
Grafana UI.
